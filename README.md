# Space Duel.
a Realtime multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors website that I built in order to learn web development.. 
The server side runs on NodeJS, Express, and Socket IO.
and the Front end is pure JavaScript , CSS and HTML. 
The website is Also responsive using Flexbox and CSS Grid and "should" work on mobiles as well.

### You can visit the website and play the game here:
